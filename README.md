His work outlines many irregularities across many states.  

Truman had seen the following gateway pundit article which sparked him to dig into data:

Truman found NYT data on elections that could be used for his analysis, he saved his specific data to an RAR file so as to prevent future changes to the dataset

Truman created a python  script to review the data, unfortunately couldnt find a way to archive so I will be storing this script within this repository.

#### Truman's Claim

Truman's claim is that votes are being switched, across the country.  This is consistent with the oddity witnessed on the night of the election, where votes seemed to disappear from Trump in the CNN live vote count feed.
